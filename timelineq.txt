22,,Sr.Diego.of.Empire.Academy,Fri Dec 06 16:37:00 CST 2013,0,,thinks this exam was a little weak on principles, foundations and structures of our government, but the many cultural references were good. Matching Supreme Court justices with their pictures was a pretty useless exercise. It seems more important to know their names, how they write, and what they think. Matching national landmarks with their pictures also seemed to be a fluffy task. Overall, the test was fun, and the electronic, online format is something that the actual Federal test should take as a minimum bar to clear.

153,54,Sun Dec 29 20:18:00 CST 2013,0,,If we could get an ETA on when servers are back up, I would be SO happy! Also give free VC!
154,54,Sun Dec 29 20:37:00 CST 2013,0,,I've been playing NBA 2K since the very first iteration of the game and this is by far the least supported game maybe in the history of sports video games. Servers are routinely down and won't allow users to connect. Now they've been down for well over 24 hours and you literally can't play 90% of the game modes because of it. Roster updates have been lackluster at best and usually don't even contain adequate ratings adjustments. The patches have fixed absolutely nothing! Game modes still crash routinely, Stephen Curry can still block shots at a Dikembe Mutumbo level, and player/team progress can still be lost in certain game modes due to freezing. VC is everywhere, essentially making the game playable for consumers who can afford to constantly be online. As well as a whole host of other issues. On top of all of this, you guys barely even provide any updates for your customers to at least put them at ease while they wait hours/days just to be able to play something other than a quick exhibition game! Are you serious NBA 2K??? - Extremely frustrated (loyal) fan
155,54,Sun Dec 29 20:45:00 CST 2013,0,,Well I guess it wasn't just me sucks that I got down to 5 games left in 1st season and even bought some vc (which I had a problem with as well) and had to delete it so does anyone know how to get those vc back lol
156,54,Sun Dec 29 21:23:00 CST 2013,0,,Roderick you shouldnt have deleted it their servers will be fixed hopefully soon and then you could access your save again. You lost the vc

Once I trick my Xbox one into letting me party chat I then have to continuously reset my nba so that the 2k servers work. We then have to pray to god that we get into the same park...even though there is a "play with friends " option. Once in a park we then wait our an entire game for 20 minutes. We finally get onto the court and get kicked right to the Xbox one dashboard. 45 minutes of my life are gone and I sincerely thank you for that.

323,54,Mon Dec 30 06:05:00 CST 2013,0,,PSN Network Down? No Season Mode. Thanks 2K. Another Fail. Whenever we star a 'new season'... there is no upfront messaging (in-game)_ that CLEARLY says we need to be connected to the 2K servers at all times, or the PSN network has to be running flawlessly 'in order to continue a season where we left off'. (Keywords: in order to continue a season where we left off) Gamers only find this out.... "after the fact".... and THAT is the problem. 2K PUT THAT IN YOUR MARKETING VIDEOS... UPFRONT. OR MAKE A SHORT, 2-MINUTE VIDEO THAT CLEARLY EXPLAINS THESE RESTRICTIONS. We did not pay $60 damn bucks for 'Quick Games' alone. Or constant Season Resets. People are blaming 2K for requiring PSN to be up in order to play what should be offline game modes in mycareer and mygm. It was a ridiculous decision to require an online connection to access those modes. Having an always on requirement for no reason is completely, solely, absolutely 2K's fault.
324,54,Mon Dec 30 06:06:00 CST 2013,0,,Why is it that my friend has been playing NBA 2k14 just fine, but many of us cannot connect to the servers?

1058,667,Sun Dec 22 10:50:00 CST 2013,0,,Hello Mr Hanks. You can just call me Zul. I just want to say that I'm a great fan of yours, and wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I also want you to know that I've just finished reading A Man On The Moon by Andrew Chaikin, and watched Apollo 13 & From The Earth To The Moon produced by you. All are marvelously inspiring stuff. I feel that you should continue making TV miniseries based on the Space Shuttle development and history. Or a take on the former Soviet Union's progress and failure on the space race in the 50s and 60s to match those of NASA's. Please tell me what you think? Thank you

1120,667,Tue Dec 31 02:03:00 CST 2013,0,,I need help patronage in the opening of the Centre for orphans in Poland Appeal to the people of good will. My name is Piotr Piotrowski was born in 1978.My childhood had been quite dramatically as an orphaned child. What later became for me a huge force of motivation.When I was older and already very lost in my life. The Lord Jesus Christ very discussed my heart, and let me see the power of love and forgiveness.Since then it's been 10 years I described it in the book under the title the road to-the history of the former slave. Since that time, the spotykalem people made hospitals and orphanages. Hope that is the Lord Jesus.At the same time, grew in me a passion for his willingness to help other children orphaned personally rozumiejonc their problems. In the meantime, I got married and I was blessed with a wonderful daughter. After some time due to the lack of work I went for profit to the Netherlands in a very bad way of life for my family. And suddenly everything happened vice versa is my daughter countries needed little encouragement as his father within three years of residence in the Netherlands, I created the first Christian meetings for the Polish community in Rotterdam and Amsterdam.But longing for my child each day, and the desire to service wsrud orphaned children, was that I think of going to Polish every day. Apart from the additional fact that the labour market in the Netherlands is not as good as people think. I would like to open in Poland such a home for orphaned children where children from the orphanage could spend the holidays holidays and nice time among loving people. And make them something along the lines of occupational therapy. I have already prepared some concrete programs for the development of such a centre. All these years have taught me a lot and i know that this instruction was needed, I learned what really is humility. My motivation and passion does not come from my own ambitions-I feel that God every day poured it in my heart.I know that without measures to do nothing.

Any part you take on you ad a shining spirit to that character!!! Hopeing you have or will receive Christ as your Lord and Savior--You would make a great Christian. Mike and Stephanie.

1177,667,Fri Jan 17 14:43:00 CST 2014,0,,To whoever has a chance to read my messages This is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand. I am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country. I believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children. Second group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power. The third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves. The last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand. About the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist. I am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people. There are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing. Pry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen. Our King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally. He works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy. This is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat. GO TO HELL You are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen. Our country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish. Again just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are. Yinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!! Get out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand. I apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling. I apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here. I do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.
1178,667,Fri Jan 17 14:43:00 CST 2014,0,,Thank you very much for all your supports. I am a small person as an ant on earth who is willing to change the world for a better place for me, my family for all of us who live in this world.

Should I use go to Heaven in stead??? I am sorry for my poor judgement skill. I thought Hell is the word that has been taught by our Buddha many many years ago for a comparison of good and bad. I am sorry if I do not use good word like go to heaven. So sorry for my poor not-well educated knowledge. I do not have a doctor degree from Cambridge, Oxford or Stanford. I only have a Master Degree from an unknown school in San Francisco.

Hey, put Jay Z in again cause that makes total fucking sense. Wow you suck!!! So many problems with the game and people are complaining and your posting some shitty ass award, get fucked.

1220,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:26:00 CST 2013,0,,Path to Greatness is a fuckin' joke. and I don't know when you will fix rebounds in this game. 2k13 was a way better. only graphics looks amazing. that's not enough.
1221,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:28:00 CST 2013,0,,Only competition is live? Really wtf people is best sports game category not best basketball category madden fifa nhl tiger woods all of those are in that category

1228,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:41:00 CST 2013,0,,That's all well and good 2k but have you all patched the damn game yet....successfully? Nope! This game needs a serious roster update some patches for the glitches and finally a damn jersey update. These are the same jerseys from 2k13!!!! What the fuck are you doing Ronnie 2k? Are you satisfied with the way this game is glitching or are you sooo happy with the money you've received for this game that you don't care? The game won't even work sometimes and on top of that (as I've said before) the whole new York Knicks home team is INVISIBLE including the bench!! I've bought 2k after 2k and never have I ever seen something this sad...
1229,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:41:00 CST 2013,0,,its great.. but I saved my season during a game and now when I like to load it.. it shows my player sitting behind a desk and no button works… WTF !??

1232,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:45:00 CST 2013,0,,Why should you all get any reward at all for a glitchy game that doesn't even work??? Wtf that makes no sense whatsoever that you all would receive complements or any type of award for some shortly work. The graphics look great but what does that mean if you can't play the damn game.
1233,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:46:00 CST 2013,0,,Oh and update the fucking rosters and jerseys already
1234,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:47:00 CST 2013,0,,Congrats 2K. Well deserved. Dismiss all the haters, NBA Live fanboys, and the idiots with ridiculous complaints. You guys put your heart and soul into this game and it shows. No its not perfect but its damn sure a giant step towards perfection. Now lets try and get the NFL to stop giving exlusive rights to the Madden so you can stomp that franchise out as well.

1243,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:56:00 CST 2013,0,,Wow. To me this game is amazing. Mycareer is a lot of fun and i just havent had all the problems im reading about. My one complaint is the game is really hard. The cpu goes on runs and kill me. Rebounds are tough to come by also
1244,1193,Tue Dec 10 02:59:00 CST 2013,0,,2k14 is trash. Half of the people that plays let the computer play defense for them. It sucks to play the AI in online play when I'm suppose to playing a person. When all the do is sit back watch the game play defense for them instead on ball playing manually
1245,1193,Tue Dec 10 03:07:00 CST 2013,0,,2k14 needs an update

1261,1193,Tue Dec 10 04:22:00 CST 2013,0,,My career is garbage. Does 2k really expect ppl to play all 82 games of each season. Like why can't I sim a game.. who the hell wants to play the bobcats back to back. Plus gm mode just crashes on you. I'm sittin playing and in OT with 10 seconds left and I'm up 3 it just crashed. Like wtf.. also when did nba players forget how to dribble. Feels like I'm controlling a bunch of kids trying to ball. Since when do nba point guards just lose the ball on their own foot when trying to do a cross over. Also why can I block centers with point guards? Also what's up with the passing... on a fast break you do a pass to hit a corner 3 and your player just throws it out of bounds. This 2k is absolutely trash. Looks nothing like a real game. I'm gonna stick to fifa and Madden. Actual sport sims. Not this 2k arcade bs lol. Sooo fake

Its so bad that the news papers are asking can I make a impact! ! I dominated the entire league in rookie year..how that for a f@cking impact? ? Where's the champagne, the magazine cover hailing me the new king...wheres my trip to the damn white house???

After 2 weeks of pulling my hair out in frustration I am trading it in for NBA Live. I would rather play a game that looks a little crappy than not be able to play a great looking game at all. I hope that more gamers follow suit and do the same. Only then will developers actually listen to the community and make games that work. And btw 7500cc for a pair of Jordans? Fine, but make the rewards reflect this high price. Really? 600cc for pulling down 5000 rebounds? Stupid!!!

The grind needed for this game isnt even worth it. Microtransactions will be the death of console gaming. No one wants to pay $60+ dollars, only to be nickeled and dimed to death on in game purchases for things that should already be included in the game. When will this blatant greed end?

1338,1193,Mon Dec 30 12:35:00 CST 2013,0,,DON'T GIVE ME THAT HAPPY HOLIDAYS SHIT, Some one asked me if they should get 2KAN'T connect to the servers today and I told them not to get it, i hated to do it, but why should anyone else lose money. I feel like an ass because i got this piece of excrement 3 times. ps3 ps4 ebox 1. but that is me being over enthusiastic about a game i have been playing for 20 years. but again your servers have always been kooky. FIX THE DAMN GAME, OR WE WILL TELL PEOPLE NOT TO BY THE SHIT. and i tried to return the shit and the store told me no returns, because of copy rights AHHGGGGG. #WEAREDISSAPOINTEDINYOU.
1339,1193,Mon Dec 30 01:56:00 CST 2013,0,,Same crap here I think its so dumb if the servers are down you can't play the game what idiot thought this was a good idea. Such a retarded not smart thing to do.On top of that I better not loose my player and upgrades I put into him I swear if I loose everything after doin my career now able to start... And win 50 games in a row there is going to be a nice lawsuit coming for you idiots,, FIX Your Severs!!!!

1524,1342,Sat Dec 14 17:44:00 CST 2013,0,,Hi,I would ADVİCE you to investigate the religion of İslam but you need the right resources to examine.For example İmam Ghazali,İmam Rabbani and Mevlana Rumi's books.And of course you should read the Quran. I know christians thinks all muslims are terrorists but it's certainly not true.This is entirely purposeful propaganda. YOU can talk with Joshua Evans American Muslim,you can take information from him,you can find him in youtube Sure you will find peace and happiness in İslam

My father, who was a naturalized American citizen, served in the Army Air Corps as a radio operator on transport planes flying over the "Hump" in the China-Burma-India Theater. He was awarded the DFC for flying the damaged plane back to their base after both pilots were wounded. My mother also served as a WAVE in the Navy. Sadly, they are both long gone now.

2210,2073,Wed Dec 04 17:48:00 CST 2013,0,,Dear Tom, my name is Emil Kaiypov. I am a citizen of the Kyrgyz Republic, a lawyer, and a father of two children. The proposal for which I am asking your kind support is the suspension of all currently existing hostilities on Earth before the start of Olympic Games in Sochi. The main goal of my entire project is to save and improve the lives of children who are suffering from the present conflicts and violence. The challenge is to create a moment of "pause" [a technical term from video language] in hostilities now and in the future, as well as to refusal to restart them at all. I believe that in this context, such "pause" in the war action seems do-able and practical, much more effective than the idealistic and utopian pressing of an imaginary "stop" button. In the future the first action will equate to the second: "pause" will become "stop". In order to alert the international community and potential supporters, I made a demonstration of my own at 18 October 2013 on the territory of Syrian embassy in Beirut, with poster "pause the war". The purpose of this demonstration, is to show through an example that: 1) one person has the power to perform an action directed to the benefit of all mankind. 2) no one should be indifferent, when war is concerned. 3) war requires us to drop everything else, in order to stop it. Daily activities, against the background of war, look meaningless and empty. I believe, that this idea will resonate and supporters will wish to join it. The age of information technologies, will help to spread it around the globe. Definitely there will be supporters among the world's famous celebrities. In the event that a large number of ordinary people and celebrities join this campaign, the dream to stop all military actions on the planet will be realized. This will serve as an occasion to announce the call for volunteers in the "international army of peace". It will consist of unarmed "soldiers" who are ready at any time, to go to the hot spot to "pause" the hostilities with the fact of their presence and to encourage the warring parties to engage in dialogue. Ideally, this army should consist of a world-famous and beloved celebrities from all spheres of human activities. I suggest that countries be ready to support my initiative, in solidarity, by placing on the cloth of their national flags, the well-known pause symbol "II". I believe that in the course of implementation of this anti-war action, the reasons for which the suspended armed conflict began, will be resolved or continued in a civilized manner. This anti-war action will bring about a new peaceful reality, when there will be no state left, which "international army of peace" had not visited. The termination of all hostilities, will become the point of departure for further continuous progress in all directions. We are able to bring about the time, when the world will be fairly managed by a workable international organization which will be trusted by all citizens of the earth. When this happens, all kinds of weapons will be transferred to international United Nations control, the purpose of which, will be the preservation of peace and sustainable development of mankind. We live in a world, when the collective effort makes possible the colonizing of other planets in the foreseeable future. I believe, that we have enough strength and resources for the child born tomorrow to see a world, where uniform international standards of education, labor, pension and medical care, will be established everywhere. A world, where the primary human needs will be satisfied for free. A world, where nobody talks about freedom, because absolute freedom will accompany each person from the moment of birth, to his last breath. A world, where the happiness and freedom of the individual, will not happen in isolation but will include freedom and happiness of all of humanity. A world without war. A world without war is undisputed goal, that sooner or later humanity will definitely reach. It is the primary duty of every adult to fulfill a "world in peace"-- everyone’s childhood dream. Every child surrounded by the horrors of war dreams that one day somebody will come and say "It is enough!" and by saying it bring war to an end. Then war will stop. That day has come! It's time to combine our efforts in order to make that dream come true.https://www.facebook.com/groups/pausethewar/

I wonder if you would spare a moment to call my Aunt Jean, Earl's wife of 67 year (all the media is saying 76 years but it is actually 67 years) and a military vet herself, with your condolences? It would literally take 60 seconds of your time. I know this is a long shot that you will even read this but it is worth it to try as my Aunt Jean is very admirative of you for your passion for telling it like it was. To hear your voice would brighten her heart and maybe even put a smile on her face that hasn't been seen since the day before Uncle Earl's passing :*-(

2219,2073,Sun Dec 08 08:51:00 CST 2013,0,,Hi Tom, just a long time fan. Love all your movies. I was hoping you would like to make a movie on about my son a ten year vet about PTSD which thousands of soldiers are dealing with. Somebody needs to raise awareness about and I think you are just that person. I have two identical twin boys, now men, who went into the U.S. ARMY together 11 years ago at the age of 18, now both 29. This disorder is so real and raw it will shake you to your very core and to watch my sons struggle with this daily is to much to bear. I can just imagine what other soldiers and family are going thru. They can't sleep, they break down crying anytime, nightmares, addictions to sex, drugs, and alcohol. Have displaced anger and not switch back and forth from war to family life. They can not function in their life and have depression and compulsion disorders. The government has the nerve to kick them to the curb when they serve their time and give them shit. Sorry I am a little angry. I feel so helpless and have been struggling to keep my son alive from taking his life, because of this PTSD. Please Help these young man and women from all branches of service to be treated like they should with honor and help they deserve for everyone freedom. Freedom comes at a price for those who are brave to defend it and voluntary I might add and are willing to do so without compliant to keep America free. Thank You

2233,2073,Wed Dec 11 10:02:00 CST 2013,0,,Nobody is saying that Africans in Africa will ever be a minority Nobody is saying that Asians in Asia will ever be a minority. So why are they saying Whites will be a minority in Britain in 2036? And Sweden in 2024? That’s because there’s MASSIVE non-White immigration in EVERY White country and ONLY White countries. Because there’s a program of White geNOcide. They say it’s “anti-racist” but it’s simply anti-White. Anti-Racist is a code for anti-White.

Same gameplay for the most part, same my player faces/hairstyles and tattoos. Looks a little cleaner and the rosters are nice. And damn straight PG is a beast, Pacers takin it all this year.

I understand there's millions of requests coming through but when one comes enough you should spend more time evaluating it and try to discuss fixing it. Likr player introductions. Who wouldn't want that.. its 2014 soon so we expect more of what we want in a game. I love this Years game only becuase i've loved 2k13 & this one is pretty much nba 2k13.5 but its all good cause for better development I don't mind the wait. Start to understand your readers though and focus more on what they want..

2299,2246,Wed Oct 02 15:48:00 CST 2013,0,,leanord and green stopped lebron in the playoffs but as usual the refs call everything for lebron even if its a clean block, and lebron is getting schooled by kobe while hes on his prime lebron is a great player but he will never be known as one of the greatest plus lebron cries about everything lets not forget when he got a leg cramp and had to be carried out by his team mates
2300,2246,Wed Oct 02 16:04:00 CST 2013,0,,Just so u guys know my player mode is exactly the same as last year presentation and commentary nearly the same as well... Game play is a bit different a little harder. I love 2k way better than live but they're getting lazy and becoming a copy and paste game like ea sports does...

I cant even understand what you just said, but assuming you are defending the game I will say this; 2k makes billions of our money and continues to put out an unfinished and sub-par product. You are happy with it because you are a simpleton with nothing to compare this game to. They false advertised bringing back crew and then gave us 5v5 blacktop. You may be okay with that because youre an idiot and love being given unfinished and sub-par products but I am not. They can do much better and if they wanted more business they should have listened to the dozens of consultants that they brought in instead of shitting on their thoughts about the games.

When ABA was founded in 1975, our organization did have an Asian focus as we were a minority in business, but we have always been open to all majors and ethnicities and have since then shifted our focus to appeal to a broader range of students. We encourage you to attend our events next semester to see for yourself if our organization is a "a disgrace to the Berkeley name."

What happens when the lights go out is we all divide up the food left in the production bin and scoff it whilst waiting for the taxis u paid to get us home. Great employer, put me through Uni and let me work all over the uk through the summer so I could travel and work. Too company thanks.

2896,2844,Tue Dec 31 09:11:00 CST 2013,0,,Hey McDonalds, why is it that you see it necessary to charge $1 for water? I would think water could be a courtesy when we spend so much otherwise. As if that isn't bad enough, you dont even tell us you are charging us and then when I talk to the manager about it, he asks how they know I didnt know there was a charge. Because I just told you I didn't know and now you are calling me a liar! Great customer service there jerks
2897,2844,Tue Dec 31 09:17:00 CST 2013,0,,cute

3369,3324,Fri Dec 20 09:29:00 CST 2013,0,,Hi Evren, after you explained what happened I guess McDonald's no longer wish to cater for or make younger people welcome in their restaurants. Unless I get a full apology from them I will not be stepping foot inside their establishments again. after accepting your money for a festive meal to then deny you access to seating on the first floor when downstairs was full for the only reason I can deduce that you were a young adult (they were allowing others up). you done the right thing not to argue but just wait until someone left downstairs and then eat your by then cold food.

3388,3324,Sat Dec 28 09:55:00 CST 2013,0,,Butch Simms: Yes. It's just basic economics. Let's say they *do* raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Results? 1) as you said, prices go up. 2) They will be forced to cut workers' hours, and perhaps even 3) lay off workers. So the workers (at least, the ones who still have their jobs) will have their $15 an hour, but still not be making overall much more than they are now, because they will be working fewer total hours. The rest will be stuck with unemployment until they manage to find other jobs.

The most recent...get my first poutine and they don't put a fork in the bag. Never mind the fork, the gravy was cold. Like I mean cold. The fries themselves were warm at best. My other fries were warm at best I ask for diet coke and coke. They give my two cokes I ordered maybe a few weeks prior. Everything was cold. I don't live far and in the past it's still been hot. I eat my fries immediately so I know when they are just plain old cold I saw a post from a friend who also lives in Orangeville and it said, you know Mcdonalds screws up too much when even my little daughter says "what did they screw up this time" Honestly these are my two most recent. It happens far too often. The mistakes are one thing. Constantly forgetting stuff and constantly getting cold food is a real problem

Europeans do not use dimethylsiloxane. Look closely at the ingredients in McDonald’s french fries below. Do you see how the french fries in the U.K. version are basically just potatoes, vegetable oil, a little sugar and salt? How can McDonald’s make french fries with such an uncomplicated list of ingredients all over Europe, but not over here? Why do McDonald’s french fries in the U.S. have to have an “anti-foaming” agent? Do the brits like extra foam? No, they don’t, Europe actually regulates this ingredient because they know this man-made chemical was never intended to be consumed by humans. This whole time McDonalds has known about this and chooses to continue to serve it’s US citizens silly putty. McDonalds French Fries Ingredients.

Excited about this promotion I ordered the items that should have been included Classic Quarter Pounder, and Medium Fry. Needless to say I got standard packaging with no promotional codes. If I knew that they would't be supplying them I would have changed my order. Hard to say I'm Lovin' it :(

3535,3469,Thu Dec 05 23:37:00 CST 2013,0,,Dear McDonald's, I just saw a news report saying your employees are going on strike, asking for a pay increase to $15 an hour. I'm outraged. This is a job that requires no experience, no intelligence, and no back-breaking labor. Construction workers that spend 8-12 hours a day digging ditches don't even start at $15 an hour. How is it fair to even consider paying an employee of a fast food restaurant that flips burgers and ask people, " do you want fries with that ?", more pay than people that break their backs and actually work? It's not fair and I pray this is something that will not change. McDonald's employees are at a good rate of pay as it is. If they don't like it, find another job. Thank you. Sincerely, A pissed off American
3536,3469,Fri Dec 06 12:09:00 CST 2013,0,,15 an hour? Um I don't think so Scooter.

3541,3469,Fri Dec 06 01:57:00 CST 2013,0,,and these are the people that think they deserve $15 an hour!!!!! Doubtful!!!! If they get that big of a raise, I hope they make their sandwich's more appealing to the eye instead of throwing it together so that it looks like a 2 yr. old threw it together. Every time I get a sandwich at McDonald's, the sandwich ingredients never line up with each other and looks like such a mess!!!! Disgusting I think!!!!! Much more enjoyable if it looks good

3551,3469,Fri Dec 06 08:38:00 CST 2013,0,,McNuggets contain chicken, water, flour (maize, bleached wheat), salt, canola oil, thickener (1404), raising agents and mineral salts (341, 451, 450, 500, 541, 551, 327), spice and wheat starch. The McNuggets are cooked in a canola oil blend, but we’re not told how much oil is absorbed. All the additives are legal, but even if they make up only 5% of the final product, you might ask why McDonald's adds 15 ingredients to the chicken (McBites have 25). And how much is "some" chicken skin? The nutrition information tells us six nuggets (about 100g) have 18g of fat. If the "95% of the meat portion" were all chicken breast, it would contribute 1.5g of fat. So "some skin" plus the canola oil blend would contribute 16.5g of fat -- or 92% of the fat.

More over, I urge everyone who like to live longer or who doesn't wish to grow a third chin to not eat at McDonalds. (the nuggets contain 27 chemicals and are far from chicken).

But for now No. Not after spending 2 hrs cleaning up a big mess. M/D can kiss my butt. They should take a lesson from Jack in the Box. Their lids don't come off even if the drink falls on the floor board.

3809,3639,Sun Nov 17 01:04:00 CST 2013,0,,I"M NOT LOVING IT I am utterly disgusted at the treatment I received from A manager named Tori from your Hervey Bay Restaurant. We (My Partner and I) were travelling home late tonight about 1:00 a.m. and remembered your ads from TV about $2 Burgers. We thought we would have one as a quick snack. We ordered them through the Drive-Thru. Whilst doing so we noticed a big sign advertising the $2 Cheesy Bbq Burger. When we arrived at the Drive Thru window, we were told it will be $5.40. Two lots of $2 is $4 not $5.40. Of course we questioned why it was not $4. We were told that after 12:00am that the price goes up. We were also rudely told that it is on the sign, as the girl serving us moved away. So we were left at the Drive Thru window. No one serving us and a manager was talking to us from a distant. I asked the manager whether the sign in the Drive Thru stated about the price change and she didn't answer me. I thought maybe she hadn't heard, so I spoke up more and asked again, whether the sign in the Drive Thru stated the price change after 12:00a.m. (I know it doesn't as I have taken photo graphical evidence of the fact) This Manager then rudely proceeded for the second time not to answer my question. She then came over to the window and say that if you don't like it to bad and she doesn't have to serve people who are aggressive. She shut the windows in our faces. At No time were we aggressive. We asked a question, which we have every right to have that question answered, unless somehow this manager gets to pick and choose who Mc Donald's will be taking as a customer. I have never been treated so rudely from someone who has been put in a supervisory role and is expected to deal with the public.

Well, I guess nothing gets by you! Other than the fact that the ingredients are plastered on the side of all their products. What more can they do? Do you need a counselor at the drive-thru to counsel you before you buy? don't BUY it if you don't like it. that is the best way to get a company to change.
